@TODO
Once item is done/tested, remove it from the list


Ast
string_of_expr for List<char> -> Charlist etc

Semantic Checker
-vmember and assignm
-newobj (charmap, stringmap, charlist, listlist)
-add back in the dictionary stuff
-go over and make sure it complies with the specs
-refactor if there's time
-check the list.rev in for/foreach/while

Legitimate Test Suite
-see test-suite

LRM
-curly quotes to straight
-standardize format (line spacing, font size, etc)
-variable scope (clarify): one per function (even in cond/loop should be); what is default value (if any)
-when you are not allowed to assign variables
-limits on string literals (they can have newlines!), escaped quote char is poss?, what about "\n?"
-getsetters (explain the semantics in builtin function section)
-equality of reference
-exit as a reserved keyword
-what is exactly allowed to have a binop and which binop
-add to lang features that str + int + str = str
-modifying maps while foreaching them
-only VARIABLE DOT VARIABLE (explain this)
-how to use null
-any updates made in syntax

BUILTINS (ostdlib.c)
-StringToList
-charmap, stringmap, and player structs
-implement constants (dictionary and letterScore) as map
-print map
-anagram() (takes dictionary as param)
-readDict() (returns dictionary so it's implicitly (ASsign(dictionary, readDict())))
-map.destroy()/contains()/getLength()/get()/geti() for strings and chars
-subStrings()
-listlist to string??


Standard Library (.olh)
-Write standard library functions (list here)
-Hook them into code we write via the compiler (how?) https://piazza.com/class/jaiu2g6r8py36c?cid=321

Compiler (codegen.ml)
-add builtin constants (dictionary) when appropriate
-add structs and other builtin types
-variable scope: make sure to build it out for stuff definied inside loops/blocks
-SVmember (members of objects: change them from calls to getsetters using build_call)
-SLiteralm (literal maps)
-SAssignm (member assigning)
-SNewobj/SNewtobj (allocating space for new objects)
-SNewlis of listlist (and SLiterall for lists of lists)
-add_terminal for all return types
-add builtins for strlen and others
-null comparisons/null pointer
