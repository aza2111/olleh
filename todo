@TODO
Once item is done/tested, remove it from the list

ALL FILES
-comment code, explain anything that's ambiguous or confusing to you (or that you think
  might need explaining to tfs/townsend)
-sign with whoever worked on it


Semantic Checker
-go over and make sure it complies with the specs
-refactor if there's time


Legitimate Test Suite
-see test-suite
-also, edit testall.sh so all are comparing vs a diff file
-and make sure tests/output do match
-there's no way to test random() or readInput()--put that in LRM note maybe
-test empty dictionary, redefining stdlib functions


LRM
-curly quotes to straight; code to courier
-standardize format (line spacing, font size, all Null, etc)
-any updates made in syntax (check against parser/semant at very end)
-no statements after return

-modifying maps while foreaching them (once that section's written)
-fresh list default
-setLetters is lowercase; will set player's letters only for the size of their letters currently
-printing null will print (null) for string but not for map/list
-string rep of zero size charlist is ['']
-maps with same key twice getting resolved to last occurence
-behavior with negative fresh list is a negative malloc, which is bad (allocates a large number
 of bytes so be aware that this is a possibility)
-strings aren't immutable either
-fresh listlist has autodimension but u can have a list of any length.
-out of bounds behavior on lists
-reserved keywords of stdlib local variables (you may not use them for global names)
 (w_, temp_, lett_, letters_, len_, i_, ch_, temp2_, temp3_, x_)

Compiler (codegen.ml)
-stringmap set/destroy for vmember
