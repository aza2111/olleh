@TODO
Once item is done/tested, remove it from the list

Parser/Scanner
-remove quotes from string literal representation
-naming an identifier "main" is illegal
-remove is just a normal function, don't single it out
-figure out global variables

LRM
-decide what is builtin and what is stdlib
-flesh out definitions/avoid ambiguity

BUILTINS (ostdlib.c)
-rename file
-list builtins to be added below...

Semantic Checker (due 4/9)
-implement globals (& tracking locals) once they're fixed in parser/scanner
-type-check lists and maps
-type-check functions on objects (such as x.remove(y))
-string concatenation with + operator (if we want to implement it)
-assigning to a member of an object (x.y = z)
-calling a function on an object
-new object creation
-for loops, foreach
-binding

Compiler (codegen.ml)
-add structs and other builtin types (line 17/29)
-global variables
-SVmember (members of objects)
-SLiterall (literal lists)
-SLiteralm (literal maps)
-SAssignm (member assigning)
-SAssign (variable assigning)
-SBinop for non-integers (if needed)
-SNewobj/SNewtobj (allocating space for new objects)
-SCallm (calling a function on an object)
-SFor
-SReturn
-SIf
-SForeach
-build_ret for all return types
