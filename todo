@TODO
Once item is done/tested, remove it from the list

ALL FILES
-comment code, explain anything that's ambiguous or confusing to you (or that you think
  might need explaining to tfs/townsend)


Semantic Checker
-remove letterscores
-inttostring as func
-player: duplicate arguments
-add any more builtins that are allowed to be called by the user (check vs lrm)
-go over and make sure it complies with the specs
-refactor if there's time


Legitimate Test Suite
-see test-suite
-also, edit testall.sh so all are comparing vs a diff file
-and make sure tests/output do match


LRM
-curly quotes to straight; code to courier
-standardize format (line spacing, font size, all Null, etc)
-any updates made in syntax (check against parser/semant at very end)
-no statements after return (if that's a thing)

-modifying maps while foreaching them (once that section's written)
-fresh list default

Standard Library (.olh)
-Write standard library functions (list here)
 letterScores constant map
 getWordScore
 setLetterScore
 checkWord
 setLetters
 getLength (of a string)
 reverse
 scramble
-Hook them into code we write via the compiler (how?) https://piazza.com/class/jaiu2g6r8py36c?cid=321


Compiler (codegen.ml)
-inttostring
-player functionality
-stringmap set/destroy for vmember
-SNewobj (allocating space for new objects:
 set players to malloc, how to set elems: build const ptr and copy it over
