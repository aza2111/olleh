@TODO
Once item is done/tested, remove it from the list

ALL FILES
-comment code, explain anything that's ambiguous or confusing to you (or that you think
  might need explaining to tfs/townsend)


Semantic Checker
-compare string to null
-player: duplicate arguments
-go over and make sure it complies with the specs
-refactor if there's time


Legitimate Test Suite
-see test-suite
-also, edit testall.sh so all are comparing vs a diff file
-and make sure tests/output do match
-there's no way to test random() or readInput()--put that in LRM note maybe


LRM
-curly quotes to straight; code to courier
-standardize format (line spacing, font size, all Null, etc)
-any updates made in syntax (check against parser/semant at very end)
-no statements after return (if that's a thing)

-modifying maps while foreaching them (once that section's written)
-fresh list default
-setLetters is lowercase; will set player's letters only for the size of their letters currently
-printing null will print (null) for string but not for map/list
-string rep of zero size charlist is ['']

Standard Library (standard-lib.olh)
-Hook into code we write via the compiler (how?) https://piazza.com/class/jaiu2g6r8py36c?cid=321


Compiler (codegen.ml)
-player functionality
-stringmap set/destroy for vmember
-SNewobj (allocating space for new objects:
 set players to malloc, how to set elems: build const ptr and copy it over
